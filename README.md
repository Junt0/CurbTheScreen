# CurbTheScreen
##Introduction
CurbTheScreen is software that can help you manage your screen time in a healthier way. This is especially useful for 
anyone who may or may not have a slight addiction/love for video games, but also wants to make sure they have time left 
for other things they enjoy. Many similar programs don't often take into account the age old problem for gamers. 
You can't pause an online match. This program isn't a cure for screen addiction, but rather, it's a way to help create 
a better balance in a world that is filled with temptations. 

##Goals
- To create a solution that is doesn't punish the user for trying to use their screen less
- To encourage spending time on other activities while balancing screen usage
- Make the user more aware of their habits
